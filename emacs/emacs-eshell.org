   Eshell comes with some interesting features:
   - ~M-RET~ can be used to accumulate further commands while a command is currently running.  Since all input is passed to the subprocess being executed, there is no automatic input queueing as there is with other shells.
   - ~C-c C-t~ can be used to truncate the buffer if it grows too large.
   - ~C-c C-r~ will move point to the beginning of the output of the last command.  With a prefix argument, it will narrow to view only that output.
   - ~C-c C-o~ will delete the output from the last command.
   - ~C-c C-f~ will move forward a complete shell argument.
   - ~C-c C-b~ will move backward a complete shell argument.

Eshell se confunde si se ejecutan los siguientes comandos, mejor que ansiterm se encargue:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package eshell
      :init
      (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
                (lambda ()
                  (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "ssh")
                  (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "tail")
                  (add-to-list 'eshell-visual-commands "top"))))
  #+END_SRC

* [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellAlias][Aliases]]

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook (lambda ()
        (eshell/alias "e" "find-file $1")
        (eshell/alias "ff" "find-file $1")
        (eshell/alias "emacs" "find-file $1")
        (eshell/alias "ee" "find-file-other-window $1")

        (eshell/alias "gd" "magit-diff-unstaged")
        (eshell/alias "gds" "magit-diff-staged")
        (eshell/alias "d" "dired $1")

        ))
  #+END_SRC

** Git

   My =gst= command is just an alias to =magit-status=, but using the
   =alias= doesn't pull in the current working directory, so I make it
   a function, instead:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell/gst (&rest args)
         (magit-status (pop args) nil)
         (eshell/echo))   ;; The echo command suppresses output
   #+END_SRC

** Encontrar un archivo

   We should have an "f" alias for searching the current directory for
   a file, and a "ef" for editing that file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell/f (filename &optional dir try-count)
       "Searches for files matching FILENAME in either DIR or the
     current directory. Just a typical wrapper around the standard
     `find' executable.

     Since any wildcards in FILENAME need to be escaped, this wraps the shell command.

     If not results were found, it calls the `find' executable up to
     two more times, wrapping the FILENAME pattern in wildcat
     matches. This seems to be more helpful to me."
       (let* ((cmd (concat
                    (executable-find "find")
                    " " (or dir ".")
                    "      -not -path '*/.git*'"
                    " -and -not -path '*node_modules*'"
                    " -and -not -path '*classes*'"
                    " -and "
                    " -type f -and "
                    "-iname '" filename "'"))
              (results (shell-command-to-string cmd)))

         (if (not (s-blank-str? results))
             results
           (cond
            ((or (null try-count) (= 0 try-count))
             (eshell/f (concat filename "*") dir 1))
            ((or (null try-count) (= 1 try-count))
             (eshell/f (concat "*" filename) dir 2))
            (t "")))))

     (defun eshell/ef (filename &optional dir)
       "Searches for the first matching filename and loads it into a
     file to edit."
       (let* ((files (eshell/f filename dir))
              (file (car (s-split "\n" files))))
         (find-file file)))
   #+END_SRC

   Typing =find= in Eshell runs the =find= function, which doesn’t do
   what I expect, and creating an alias is ineffective in overriding
   it, so a function will do:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell/find (&rest args)
       "Wrapper around the ‘find’ executable."
       (let ((cmd (concat "find " (string-join args))))
         (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
   #+END_SRC

** Limpiar

   While deleting and recreating =eshell= may be just as fast, I always
   forget and type =clear=, so let's implement it:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell/clear ()
       "Clear the eshell buffer."
       (let ((inhibit-read-only t))
         (erase-buffer)
         (eshell-send-input)))
   #+END_SRC



* Special Prompt

  Following [[http://blog.liangzan.net/blog/2012/12/12/customizing-your-emacs-eshell-prompt/][these instructions]], we build a better prompt with the Git
  branch in it (Of course, it matches my Bash prompt). First, we need
  a function that returns a string with the Git branch in it,
  e.g. ":master"

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun curr-dir-git-branch-string (pwd)
      "Returns current git branch as a string, or the empty string if
    PWD is not in a git repo (or the git command is not found)."
      (interactive)
      (when (and (not (file-remote-p pwd))
                 (eshell-search-path "git")
                 (locate-dominating-file pwd ".git"))
        (let* ((git-url (shell-command-to-string "git config --get remote.origin.url"))
               (git-repo (file-name-base (s-trim git-url)))
               (git-output (shell-command-to-string (concat "git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD")))
               (git-branch (s-trim git-output))
               (git-icon  "\xe0a0")
               (git-icon2 (propertize "\xf020" 'face `(:family "octicons"))))
          (concat git-repo " " git-icon2 " " git-branch))))
  #+END_SRC

  The function takes the current directory passed in via =pwd= and
  replaces the =$HOME= part with a tilde. I'm sure this function
  already exists in the eshell source, but I didn't find it...

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun pwd-replace-home (pwd)
      "Replace home in PWD with tilde (~) character."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((home (expand-file-name (getenv "HOME")))
             (home-len (length home)))
        (if (and
             (>= (length pwd) home-len)
             (equal home (substring pwd 0 home-len)))
            (concat "~" (substring pwd home-len))
          pwd)))
  #+END_SRC

  Make the directory name be shorter...by replacing all directory
  names with just its first names. However, we leave the last two to
  be the full names. Why yes, I did steal this.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun pwd-shorten-dirs (pwd)
      "Shorten all directory names in PWD except the last two."
      (let ((p-lst (split-string pwd "/")))
        (if (> (length p-lst) 2)
            (concat
             (mapconcat (lambda (elm) (if (zerop (length elm)) ""
                                   (substring elm 0 1)))
                        (butlast p-lst 2)
                        "/")
             "/"
             (mapconcat (lambda (elm) elm)
                        (last p-lst 2)
                        "/"))
          pwd)))  ;; Otherwise, we just return the PWD
  #+END_SRC

  Break up the directory into a "parent" and a "base":

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun split-directory-prompt (directory)
      (if (string-match-p ".*/.*" directory)
          (list (file-name-directory directory) (file-name-base directory))
        (list "" directory)))
  #+END_SRC

  Using virtual environments for certain languages is helpful to know,
  especially since I change them based on the directory.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun ruby-prompt ()
      "Returns a string (may be empty) based on the current Ruby Virtual Environment."
      (let* ((executable "~/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt")
             (command    (concat executable "v g")))
        (when (file-exists-p executable)
          (let* ((results (shell-command-to-string executable))
                 (cleaned (string-trim results))
                 (gem     (propertize "\xe92b" 'face `(:family "alltheicons"))))
            (when (and cleaned (not (equal cleaned "")))
              (s-replace "ruby-" gem cleaned))))))

    (defun python-prompt ()
      "Returns a string (may be empty) based on the current Python
       Virtual Environment. Assuming the M-x command: `pyenv-mode-set'
       has been called."
      (when (fboundp #'pyenv-mode-version)
        (let ((venv (pyenv-mode-version)))
          (when venv
            (concat
             (propertize "\xe928" 'face `(:family "alltheicons"))
             (pyenv-mode-version))))))
  #+END_SRC

  Now tie it all together with a prompt function can color each of the
  prompts components.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (defun eshell/eshell-local-prompt-function ()
      "A prompt for eshell that works locally (in that is assumes
    that it could run certain commands) in order to make a prettier,
    more-helpful local prompt."
      (interactive)
      (let* ((pwd        (eshell/pwd))
             (directory (split-directory-prompt
                         (pwd-shorten-dirs
                          (pwd-replace-home pwd))))
             (parent (car directory))
             (name   (cadr directory))
             (branch (curr-dir-git-branch-string pwd))
             (ruby   (when (not (file-remote-p pwd)) (ruby-prompt)))
             (python (when (not (file-remote-p pwd)) (python-prompt)))

             (dark-env (eq 'dark (frame-parameter nil 'background-mode)))
             (for-bars                 `(:weight bold))
             (for-parent  (if dark-env `(:foreground "dark orange") `(:foreground "blue")))
             (for-dir     (if dark-env `(:foreground "orange" :weight bold)
                            `(:foreground "blue" :weight bold)))
             (for-git                  `(:foreground "green"))
             (for-ruby                 `(:foreground "red"))
             (for-python               `(:foreground "#5555FF")))

        (concat
         (propertize "⟣─ "    'face for-bars)
         (propertize parent   'face for-parent)
         (propertize name     'face for-dir)
         (when branch
           (concat (propertize " ── "    'face for-bars)
                   (propertize branch   'face for-git)))
         (when ruby
           (concat (propertize " ── " 'face for-bars)
                   (propertize ruby   'face for-ruby)))
         (when python
           (concat (propertize " ── " 'face for-bars)
                   (propertize python 'face for-python)))
         (propertize "\n"     'face for-bars)
         (propertize (if (= (user-uid) 0) " #" " $") 'face `(:weight ultra-bold))

         (propertize " "    'face `(:weight bold)))))

    (setq-default eshell-prompt-function #'eshell/eshell-local-prompt-function)
  #+END_SRC

  Turn off the default prompt, otherwise, it won't use ours:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq eshell-highlight-prompt nil)
  #+END_SRC

  Here is the result:

* Shell Windows

  Now that I often need to quickly pop into remote systems to run a
  shell or commands, I create helper functions to create those buffer
  windows.  Each begin with =eshell-=:

** Shell Here

   Making little Shells whenever I need them:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (defun eshell-here ()
       "Opens up a new shell in the directory associated with the
     current buffer's file. The eshell is renamed to match that
     directory to make multiple eshell windows easier."
       (interactive)
       (let* ((parent (if (buffer-file-name)
                          (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name))
                        default-directory))
              (height (/ (window-total-height) 3))
              (name   (car (last (split-string parent "/" t)))))
         (split-window-vertically (- height))
         (other-window 1)
         (eshell "new")
         (rename-buffer (concat "*eshell: " name "*"))

         (insert (concat "ls"))
         (eshell-send-input)))

     (bind-key "C-!" 'eshell-here)
   #+END_SRC

   Let's try a version that doesn't put the current working directory
   in the mode-line's buffer title:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell-here ()
       "Opens up a new shell in the directory associated with the
         current buffer's file. The eshell is renamed to match that
         directory to make multiple eshell windows easier."
       (interactive)
       (let* ((height (/ (window-total-height) 3)))
         (split-window-vertically (- height))
         (other-window 1)
         (eshell "new")
         (insert (concat "ls"))
         (eshell-send-input)))

     (bind-key "C-!" 'eshell-here)
   #+END_SRC

   Used to ~C-d~ exiting from a shell? Want it to keep working, but still
   allow deleting a character? We can have it both (thanks to [[https://github.com/wasamasa/dotemacs/blob/master/init.org#eshell][wasamasa]]):

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package eshell
       :config
       (defun ha/eshell-quit-or-delete-char (arg)
         (interactive "p")
         (if (and (eolp) (looking-back eshell-prompt-regexp))
             (progn
               (eshell-life-is-too-much) ; Why not? (eshell/exit)
               (ignore-errors
                 (delete-window)))
           (delete-forward-char arg)))
       :init
       (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
                 (lambda ()
                   (bind-keys :map eshell-mode-map
                              ("C-d" . ha/eshell-quit-or-delete-char)))))
   #+END_SRC

** Shell There
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: remote-shell
   :END:

   Would be nice to be able to run an eshell session and use Tramp to
   connect to the remote host in one fell swoop:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell-there (host)
       "Creates an eshell session that uses Tramp to automatically
     connect to a remote system, HOST.  The hostname can be either the
     IP address, or FQDN, and can specify the user account, as in
     root@blah.com. HOST can also be a complete Tramp reference."
       (interactive "sHost: ")

       (let* ((default-directory
                (cond
                 ((string-match-p "^/" host) host)

                 ((string-match-p (ha/eshell-host-regexp 'full) host)
                  (string-match (ha/eshell-host-regexp 'full) host) ;; Why!?
                  (let* ((user1 (match-string 2 host))
                         (host1 (match-string 3 host))
                         (user2 (match-string 6 host))
                         (host2 (match-string 7 host)))
                    (if host1
                        (ha/eshell-host->tramp user1 host1)
                      (ha/eshell-host->tramp user2 host2))))

                 (t (format "/%s:" host)))))
         (eshell-here)))
   #+END_SRC

   Note that this function uses functions defined below.

** Shell Here to There

   Since I have Org files that contains tables of system to remotely
   connect to, I figured I should have a little function that can jump
   to a host found listed anywhere on the line.

   The regular expression associated with IP addresses, hostnames, user
   accounts (of the form, =jenkins@my.build.server=, or even full Tramp
   references, is a bit...uhm, hairy.  And since I want to reuse these,
   I will hide them in a function:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun ha/eshell-host-regexp (regexp)
       "Returns a particular regular expression based on symbol, REGEXP"
       (let* ((user-regexp      "\\(\\([[:alpha:].]+\\)@\\)?")
              (tramp-regexp     "\\b/ssh:[:graph:]+")
              (ip-char          "[[:digit:]]")
              (ip-plus-period   (concat ip-char "+" "\\."))
              (ip-regexp        (concat "\\(\\(" ip-plus-period "\\)\\{3\\}" ip-char "+\\)"))
              (host-char        "[[:alpha:][:digit:]-]")
              (host-plus-period (concat host-char "+" "\\."))
              (host-regexp      (concat "\\(\\(" host-plus-period "\\)+" host-char "+\\)"))
              (horrific-regexp  (concat "\\b"
                                        user-regexp ip-regexp
                                        "\\|"
                                        user-regexp host-regexp
                                        "\\b")))
         (cond
          ((eq regexp 'tramp) tramp-regexp)
          ((eq regexp 'host)  host-regexp)
          ((eq regexp 'full)  horrific-regexp))))
   #+END_SRC

   The function to scan a line for hostname patterns uses different
   function calls that what I could use for =eshell-there=, so let's
   =save-excursion= and hunt around:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun ha/eshell-scan-for-hostnames ()
       "Helper function to scan the current line for any hostnames, IP
     or Tramp references.  This returns a tuple of the username (if
     found) and the hostname.

     If a Tramp reference is found, the username part of the tuple
     will be `nil'."
       (save-excursion
         (goto-char (line-beginning-position))
         (if (search-forward-regexp (ha/eshell-host-regexp 'tramp) (line-end-position) t)
             (cons nil (buffer-substring-no-properties (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))

           ;; Returns the text associated with match expression, NUM or `nil' if no match was found.
           (cl-flet ((ha/eshell-get-expression (num) (if-let ((first (match-beginning num))
                                                              (end   (match-end num)))
                                                         (buffer-substring-no-properties first end))))

             (search-forward-regexp (ha/eshell-host-regexp 'full) (line-end-position))

             ;; Until this is completely robust, let's keep this debugging code here:
             ;; (message (mapconcat (lambda (tup) (if-let ((s (car tup))
             ;;                                       (e (cadr tup)))
             ;;                                  (buffer-substring-no-properties s e)
             ;;                                "null"))
             ;;             (-partition 2 (match-data t)) " -- "))

             (let ((user1 (ha/eshell-get-expression 2))
                   (host1 (ha/eshell-get-expression 3))
                   (user2 (ha/eshell-get-expression 6))
                   (host2 (ha/eshell-get-expression 7)))
               (if host1
                   (cons user1 host1)
                 (cons user2 host2)))))))
   #+END_SRC

   Tramp reference can be long when attempting to connect as another
   user account using the pipe symbol.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun ha/eshell-host->tramp (username hostname &optional prefer-root)
       "Returns a TRAMP reference based on a USERNAME and HOSTNAME
     that refers to any host or IP address."
       (cond ((string-match-p "^/" host)
                host)
             ((or (and prefer-root (not username)) (equal username "root"))
                (format "/ssh:%s|sudo:%s:" hostname hostname))
             ((or (null username) (equal username user-login-name))
                (format "/ssh:%s:" hostname))
             (t
                (format "/ssh:%s|sudo:%s|sudo@%s:%s:" hostname hostname username hostname))))
   #+END_SRC

   Finally
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun eshell-here-on-line (p)
       "Search the current line for an IP address or hostname, and call the `eshell-here' function.

     Call with PREFIX to connect with the `root' useraccount, via
     `sudo'."
       (interactive "p")
       (destructuring-bind (user host) (ha/eshell-scan-for-hostnames)
         (let ((default-directory (ha/eshell-host->tramp user host (> p 1))))
           (message "Connecting to: %s" default-directory)
           ;; With the `default-directory' set to a Tramp reference, rock on!
           (eshell-here))))

     (bind-key "M-s-1" #'eshell-here-on-line)
   #+END_SRC

** Shell Favorites

    Since the Tramp syntax is a bit verbose, a few /wrapper functions/
    would make things easier. Also, having a list of /favorite hosts/
    with simpler names would also be a nice feature.

    Since Emacs doesn't have a memoize function, define a global
    variable, =remote-shell-fav-hosts=, a hash that maps nicknames of
    hosts to their IP address.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defvar remote-shell-fav-hosts (make-hash-table :test 'equal)
       "Table of host aliases for IPs or other actual references.")
    #+END_SRC

    Can we make a list of what hosts are /pre-known/? What if no hosts
    have been defined? In this case, we want to call the function,
    =remote-shell-fav-hosts-get= to populate it:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-fav-hosts-map ()
        "Returns the mapping between our simple names of our favorite
      hosts and their IP address. If the map is empty, and the function
      `remote-shell-fav-hosts-get' has been defined, it calls that
      function to populate the map prior to returning it. This may
      return an empty map."
        (when (and #'remote-shell-fav-hosts-get
                   (hash-table-empty-p remote-shell-fav-hosts))
          (remote-shell-fav-hosts-get))
        remote-shell-fav-hosts)
    #+END_SRC

    In order to populate the =completing-read=, we need a list of hosts:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-fav-hosts-list ()
        "Simply returns a list of known hosts from the cached map, or
      populates it first if it is empty and the
      `remote-shell-fav-hosts-get' function has been defined."
        (hash-table-keys (remote-shell-fav-hosts-map)))
    #+END_SRC

    Most remote access is done with Tramp, so this function simplifies
    the complex Tramp string creation, mostly using an =sudo= pipe for
    =root= access. If the =remote-shell-fav-hosts= hash is empty, we'll
    populate it when this is called.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-tramp-connection (hostname &optional root directory)
        "Return a TRAMP connection string to HOSTNAME. If ROOT is
      non-nil, returns an sudo compatible string."
        (when (null directory)
          (setq directory ""))

        ;; The ip address is either the value from a key in our cache, or whatever we pass in:
        (let ((ipaddr (gethash hostname (remote-shell-fav-hosts-map) hostname)))
          (if root
              (format "/ssh:%s|sudo:%s:%s" ipaddr ipaddr directory)
              (format "/ssh:%s:%s"         ipaddr directory))))
    #+END_SRC

    If the window containing the results of the shell connection or
    shell command is the same, we can take advantage of that from
    multiple functions, so:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-buffer-name (hostname &optional command-str default-name)
        "Returns a standard format for our remote shell command buffer
      windows based on the HOSTNAME and the COMMAND-STR. Uses
      DEFAULT-NAME if specified."
        (cond
         (default-name     default-name)
         (command-str      (let ((command (car (split-string command-str))))
                              (format "*%s:%s*" hostname command)))
         (t                (format "*%s*" hostname))))
    #+END_SRC

    Our simple wrapper function for accessing a remote shell, should
    use =ido= if available.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell (hostname &optional root)
        "Start an shell experience on HOSTNAME, that can be an alias to
      a virtual machine from my 'cloud' server. With prefix command, opens
      the shell as the root user account."
        (interactive
         (list (if (fboundp #'ido-completing-read)
                   (ido-completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list))
                 (completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list)))))
        (when (equal current-prefix-arg '(4))
          (setq root t))
        (let ((default-directory (remote-shell-tramp-connection hostname root)))
          (shell (remote-shell-buffer-name hostname))))
    #+END_SRC

    With the way Emacs Lisp's =interactive= behaves, I'm not sure how to
    DRY this function to be a simple alias with the exception of
    using eshell:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun eshell-favorite (hostname &optional root)
        "Start an shell experience on HOSTNAME, that can be an alias to
      a virtual machine from my 'cloud' server. With prefix command, opens
      the shell as the root user account."
        (interactive
         (list (if (fboundp #'ido-completing-read)
                   (ido-completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list))
                 (completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list)))))
        (when (equal current-prefix-arg '(4))
          (setq root t))
        (let ((default-directory (remote-shell-tramp-connection hostname root)))
          (eshell (remote-shell-buffer-name hostname))))
    #+END_SRC

    Instead of starting a shell, what if we just ran a command using the
    =shell-command= (so that commands that end in a =&= are automatically
    ran asynchronously.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-command (hostname command
                                            &optional root bufname directory)
        "On HOSTNAME, run COMMAND (if the command ends with &, run
      asynchronously). With a `C-u' prefix, run the command as ROOT.
      When non-interactive, you can specify BUFNAME for the buffer's
      name, and DIRECTORY where the command should run."
        (interactive
         (list (if #'ido-completing-read
                   (ido-completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list))
                 (completing-read "Hostname: " (remote-shell-fav-hosts-list)))
               (read-string "Command: ")))
        (when (equal current-prefix-arg '(4))
          (setq root t))
        (let ((default-directory (remote-shell-tramp-connection hostname root directory)))
          (shell-command command (remote-shell-buffer-name hostname command bufname))))
    #+END_SRC

    With the above helper functions, we can loop over a list of machines,
    and kick off remote work on each one:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-commands (clients command
                                            &optional root async directory)
        "On each host entry in CLIENTS, run the shell COMMAND,
      optionally as ROOT. If ASYNC is non-nil, appends the `&' to the
      shell command in order to run it asynchronously. Runs the command
      in the default home directory unless DIRECTORY is specified."
        (if async
            (setq command (concat command " &")))
        (dolist (host clients)
          (remote-shell-command host command root nil directory)))
    #+END_SRC

    The results of each command is stored in a separate buffer, and
    since we know what the names are, this command will attempt to load
    them on the side... yeah, this is a bit ugly.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defun remote-shell-commands-show (clients command)
        "Shows each buffer of a previously executed command. For example:

              (let ((my-favs '(\"os-controller\" \"contrail-controller\"
                               \"compute\" \"nagios\" \"elk\"))
                    (command \"chef-client\"))
                (remote-shell-commands my-favs command t t)
                (remote-shell-commands-show my-favs command))"

        (delete-other-windows)
        (let ((first-time t))
          (dolist (host clients)
            (if (not first-time)
                (split-window-vertically)
              (split-window-horizontally)
              (setq first-time nil))

            (other-window 1)
            (switch-to-buffer (remote-shell-buffer-name host command))
            (balance-windows)
            (sit-for 0.5))))
    #+END_SRC

    All this work allows me to do magic:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (let ((my-favs '("os-controller" "contrail-controller"
                       "compute" "nagios" "elk"))
            (command "chef-client"))
        (remote-shell-commands my-favs command t t)
        (remote-shell-commands-show my-favs command))
    #+END_SRC

  Sometimes you just need to change something about the current file
  you are editing...like the permissions or even execute it. Hitting
  =Command-1= will prompt for a shell command string and then append
  the current file to it and execute it.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      (interactive "sCommand to execute: ")
      (let* ((file-name (buffer-file-name))

        (shell-command full-cmd)))

    (bind-key "A-1" #'execute-command-on-file-buffer)

    (defun execute-command-on-file-directory (cmd)
      (interactive "sCommand to execute: ")
      (let* ((dir-name (file-name-directory (buffer-file-name)))

        (shell-command full-cmd)))

  Some prompts, shells and terminal programs that display the exit

  project. Seems to me, that if would be useful to rejuggle those
  fringe markers so that the marker matched the command entered
  (instead of seeing a red mark, and needing to scroll back in order
  to wonder what command it was that made it). Still...
